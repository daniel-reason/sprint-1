The command line is doing all the normal computer navigation everyone does but without the fancy and more user friendly interface, ie windows. You use text commands rather than the usual mouse operations.

mkdir - make a new folder
cd - change directory/move into another folder
ls - list directory/list all items within the folder
rmdir - remove directory/deletes folder
cp - copy a file or directory
mv - moves/renames the file/folder
pwd - displays which folders you're working within
hostname - my computer's network name
help - shows a list of usable commands
exit - closes the terminal
